Thesis : Autonomous RC Car + Wi-Fi Based Indoor Localization System

• Designed and implemented a network-driven RC car by integrating a Raspberry pi microcontroller with a PWM motor and a Software Defined Radio board, to perform as a mobile signal receiver, which reduced 80% data collection cost.

• Created an advanced object detection, image view transform, and real position estimation combined algorithm based on YOLOv3 and perspective transformation, to autonomously generate fingerprints for localization model by incorporating received signal strength with position label.

• Developed a Convolutional Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) based localization model and a Vanilla LSTM based route tracking algorithm which predicted object’s location and moving state with 96% precision in real time.
